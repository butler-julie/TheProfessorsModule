The goal of this website is to give physics professors and other physics educators the knowledge they need to successfully implement the DSECOP modules (located [here](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main)) into their undergraduate physics courses. 

This site is roughly broken up into four section, detailed below. The first section introduces the main tools needed to run the modules: GitHub (a code version manager and distributer), Google Colab (a cloud based platform to run Python code in _notebook_  form), and Jupyter Notebooks (a local method for running Python code in notebook form). The second section of this website details how to run a DSECOP module using Google Colab while the third section details how to run a DSECOP module using Jupyter Notebooks. These three sections of the website contain an abundance of written instructions and videos to clearly show how each of the softwares work.

The final two sections of this website contain tips and advice for implementing the DSECOP modules in the undergraduate physics classroom and additional resouces for Python, GitHub, Google Colab, and Jupyter Notebooks.
