# Introduction to Google Colab

## What is a Python Notebook?
A Python notebook, or a Jupyter notebook, combines markdown-enabled text and executable code in one document. It allows developers to intersperse code with text, equations, and figures. The DSECOP modules are all written using notebooks, where executable Python code _cells_ can be interspersed with explanations and instructions, making for self-contained documents that provide explanations, code examples, and code practice all in one place.

## What is Google Colab?
Google Colab (or Google Colaboratory) is a cloud-based implementation for Python notebooks that has the most common Python libraries pre-installed. Google Colab has several benefits as a Python environment, especially for use in a classroom environment:
1. It is a web-based application, so as long as students can access the internet, Google Colab will run on any device. Though most DSECOP modules are not computationally intensive, having all students run the modules on Google Colab means that even those students who cannot afford powerful computers can quickly run all of the code.
2. Most common Python libraries come pre-installed on Google Colab, eliminating students' need to set up Python environments on their computers.
3. Google Colab has all of the benefits of other Google software, including collaborative editing and link sharing, which makes it easy for students to work together on assignments and share them for a grade.

Note that to use Google Colab, you need to have a Google account. Some university email accounts are Google-enabled, but if not, creating a Google account is free. [This link](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441) walks you through creating a Google account if you do not have one. If you have a Gmail email address, then you already have a Google account, and you can log in with the same information you use to access your Gmail account.

## How to Access Google Colab
There are two ways to create a new Google Colab notebook. First, Google Colab is available at [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com). On the pop-up that appears, shown below, there are several example notebooks and a blue "New Notebook" button, creating a blank notebook.

The second way to access Google Colab is through Google Drive, which can be accessed through [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive). Once on Google Drive, the "New" button, followed by "More," provides an option to create a blank notebook in Google Colab.

The video below walks through both methods of accessing Google Drive. Note that differences in operating systems and browsers will cause differences from the setup in the video. However, the steps will be the same regardless of the operating system or browser.

## How to Use Google Colab

A Google Colab notebook is built of cells. Some of the cells are for executable Python code, and some of the cells are for compiled Markdown text. Google provides an overview of creating a Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) and an overview of Markdown [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb). Maxim Ziatdinov and Mohammad Soltanieh-ha wrote another helpful resource for learning how to use Google Colab, and is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/soltaniehha/Intro-to-Colab/blob/main/Colab-Intro.ipynb#scrollTo=X1eAzUL-twns). A Python tutorial is outside of the scope of this website. However, this website's "Further Resources" section offers many helpful Python resources for beginners.

The video below walks through the basics of creating text cells in a Colab notebook, compiling them, creating code cells, and executing them.
