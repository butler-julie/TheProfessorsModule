# Introduction to Google Colab

## What is a Python Notebook?
A python notebook, or a Jupyter noteook, is a combination of markdown enabled text and executable code in one document. It allows developers to intersperse code with text, equations, and figures. The DSECOP modules are all written using notebooks, where executable Python code _cells_ can be interspersed with explanations and instructions, making for self-contained documents that provide explanations, code examples, and code practice all in one place.

## What is Google Colab?
Google Colab (or Google Colaboratory) is a cloud-based implementation for Python notebooks which has most common Python libraries pre-installed. Google Colab has several benefits as a Python environment, especially for use in a classroom environment. First, its a web-based application so as long as students have access to the internet, Google Colab will run on any device. Though most DSECOP modules are not computationally intensive having all students run the modules on Google Colab means that even those students who cannot afford powerful computers can easily run all of the code. Second, most common Python libraries come pre-installed on Google Colab, eliminating the need students to set up Python environments on their own computers. Finally, Google Colab has all of the benefits of other Google softwares, including collaborative editing and link sharing which it makes it easy for students to work together on assignments and share them for a grade.
