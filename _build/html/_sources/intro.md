The goal of this website is to give physics professors and other physics educators the knowledge they need to successfully implement the DSECOP modules (located [here](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main)) into their undergraduate physics courses. 

This site is roughly broken up into three sections, detailed below. The first section introduces the central tools needed to run the modules: GitHub (a code version manager and distributor) and Google Colab (a cloud-based platform to run Python code in _notebook_  form). The second section of this website details how to run a DSECOP module using Google Colab using one of the existing modules as an example. The final section provides some advice on how these modules can be used and also provides resources for further learning. These website sections contain abundant written instructions and videos showing how each software works.

Note that you can run these modules and notebooks using Jupyter notebooks, but we do not recommend this for a few reasons. First, all of the modules have been tested and are ensured to run on Google Colab. Second, all libraries needed to run the modules are readily available on Google Colab without further installations. Finally, when considering running these modules in a classroom, Google Colab provides a uniform environment for students already set up. This eliminates the problems that may arise from students having different hardware and software.
