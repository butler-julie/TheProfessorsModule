# Running DSECOP Modules with Google Colab

## Opening a Module in Google Colab
At the top of every notebook in the DSECOP GitHub repository is a small icon which says "Open in Colab". Clicking this link opens the notebook in Google Colab and allows you to edit the notebook and execute the code.

However, note that the notebook is currently in "Playground" mode. You can edit the notebook and run the code, but none of your changes will be saved. To save the changes you need to create a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive. There is a button in the top toolbar called "Copy to Drive", which will create a copy of the  notebook in your Google Drive account that you can edit and save your changes. Note that this requires you to have a Google Drive account and thus a Gmail address. If your school email does not have an attached Google account then you can make a Gmail account for free.

Once you click the button you should get a pop-up to open the copy in a new tab. This copy can now be edited, changed, and saved to your Google Drive account and moved around your Google Drive account just like any other file.
