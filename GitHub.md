# Introduction to GitHub

## What is GitHub?

## How to access the modules on GitHub?

GitHub can be accessed at [https://github.com](https://github.com). The DSECOP modules can be accessed at [https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP). The main page will look like this, though the folder names will change and updates as more modules are added to the repository.
