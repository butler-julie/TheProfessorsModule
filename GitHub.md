# Introduction to GitHub

## What is GitHub?

## How to access the modules on GitHub?

GitHub can be accessed at [https://github.com](https://github.com). The DSECOP modules can be accessed at [https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP). The main page will look like this, though the folder names will change and updates as more modules are added to the repository.

Each folder in this repository represents a different module. For this website, we will be using the module "Intro_to_Data_Science_Libraries" as an example module. This module, an introduction to data science libraries, can be found by clicking on the folder on the DSECOP GitHub page or by using [this link](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main/Intro_to_Data_Science_Libraries).

## Modules Contents on GitHub
Each of the modules found on GitHub has three main components: a README file which provides a description of the modules with learing outcomes and suggestions from the developer, a data set (usually with a .tsv, .csv, or .txt file ending), and notebooks which named numerically in the order they are to be completed. The contents of the Introduction to Data Science Libraries are as follows:

~[Introduction to Data Science Libraries](https://github.com/butler-julie/TheProfessorsModule/blob/main/IntroDataScienceLibraries.png?raw=true)

There is only one notebook in this module (01_introduction_to_data_science_libraries.ipynb). If there was a second notebook in this module to be completed after the first its name would start with a "02" prefix, the third notebook with a "03" prefix, and so on. The data file for this module is called "nuclear_data.tsv" and contains the data used by the notebook. The third file of this module, README.md, is a description of the module provided by the developer. For every module the README file will automatically open below the contents of the module, as shown in the below image.
