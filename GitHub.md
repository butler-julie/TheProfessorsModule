# Introduction to GitHub

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control software Git. Git allows for distributed development of software across teams that allows users to manage and track code changes and collaborate. GitHub, besides providing an interface for developers using Git, allows for code sharing through the use of _repositories_. A repository is a container for a project. These repositories can hold the code for a project and images, videos, text files, PDF files, and much more. The DSECOP collaboration uses GitHub as a version control software to develop the modules collaboratively and as a code distribution platform for the finished modules. This webpage walks you through accessing the modules on the GitHub website. A video walkthrough is included at the end of this webpage, along with some resources for learning more about Git and GitHub.

Note that you can access the modules on GitHub without creating an account, but to use some of the more advanced features of GitHub, you will need a free account.

## How do you access the modules on GitHub?

GitHub can be accessed at [https://github.com](https://github.com). The DSECOP modules can be accessed at [https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP). The main page will look like this, though the folder names will change and updates as more modules are added to the repository.

Each folder in this repository represents a different module. For this website, we will use the module "Intro_to_Data_Science_Libraries" as an example. This module, an introduction to data science libraries, can be found by clicking on the folder on the DSECOP GitHub page or by using [this link](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main/Intro_to_Data_Science_Libraries).

## Modules Contents on GitHub
Each of the modules found on GitHub has three main components:
* a README file, which describes the modules with learning outcomes and suggestions from the developer
* a data set (usually with a .tsv, .csv, or .txt file ending)
* notebooks, which are named numerically in the order they are to be completed
  
_Notebooks_ are a file type that allows text to be interspersed with executable Python code. These are explained in more detail in the next section. The contents of the Introduction to Data Science Libraries are as follows:

There is only one notebook in this module (01_introduction_to_data_science_libraries.ipynb). If there was a second notebook in this module to be completed after the first, its name would start with a "02" prefix, the third notebook with a "03" prefix, and so on. The data file for this module is called "nuclear_data.tsv" and contains the data used by the notebook. The third file of this module, README.md, describes the module provided by the developer. The README file will automatically open below the module's contents for every module, as shown in the image below.

![README Location](https://github.com/butler-julie/TheProfessorsModule/blob/main/README.png?raw=true)

To access either the notebooks or the data set, you have to click on the name. For example, clicking on the name of this module's notebook (01_introduction_to_data_science_libraries.ipynb) brings up a preview of the notebook, shown below. Note that you can preview the notebook with all its code and outputs on GitHub, but you cannot change or run the code in this mode. To run and make changes to the code, you will need to use Google Colab, described in the next section.

A video walkthrough of accessing the DSECOP modules on GitHub is provided below. Note that there may be some differences in appearance with different browsers and operating systems, but the steps of accessing the modules will be the same.

## Further GitHub Resources
GitHub is much more than just a website to view repositories created by others. GitHub provides an [excellent set of tutorials])(https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) on using their full software. An easy way to download and modify code found on GitHub is through the [GitHub desktop app](https://desktop.github.com).
